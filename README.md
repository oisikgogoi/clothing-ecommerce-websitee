ecommerce website created using react and firebase. it works perfectly fine . 

users can perform all the actions that a normal ecommerce website allows us to perform . we can add thing to cart and even checkout . 

although i havent implemented payment features, once checkouted , it will send me an email with the order summary and the form details so tht i can use those details to perform cash on delevery .
